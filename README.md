Candidate topic #1: An application of data mining in analyzing the job market of COVID (recommended by Carson).<br>

1st level data may requires mining:<br>
1) work experience (student/graduate/1-3/3-5/5+)<br>
2) level/rank of jobs (intern/junior/senior/...)<br>
3) distribution among major cities in Canada (we may need to discuss which cities should be included, i.e. top # based on population, etc.)<br>
4) Education (need to decide whether or not include any requires Master's degree. Phd is not considered in this research)<br>
2nd level data may requires mining:<br>
5) annual/monthly salaries - requires 1) 2) and maybe 3) 4). <br>

From Carson:<br>
we need to consider broaden the scope to other social aspects impacted by COVID - need discussions <br>
in addition to front-end visualization, we need back end mining engine to support vis and provide info for vis.<br>

Temp list of tasks:<br>
Note: We better can generate conclusions from each pattern/relation.<br>
1. How many categories do IT jobs have? What is the percentage of each? What is the geographic distrubution?<br>
2. How many ranks do IT jobs have? What is the relation between rank/required exp, rank/salary, rank/required edu?<br>
3. What is the relation between salary and experience/job level/education?<br>
4. Consider all other factors are same, how much does the geographic factor will affect the salary?<br>
5. Among all jobs posted by Canadian government, how many % of them are IT related? Is it showing a growth or decline?<br>
