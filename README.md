2) level of jobs (intern/junior/senior/...)<br>
3) distribution among major cities in Canada (we may need to discuss which cities should be included, i.e. top # based on population, etc.)<br>
4) Education (need to decide whether or not include any requires Master's degree. Phd is not considered in this research)

2nd level data may requires mining:<br>
5) annual/monthly salaries - requires 1) 2) and maybe 3) 4). <br>
